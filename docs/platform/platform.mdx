# How Dokaai Works

Dokaai is a notification platform that connects your product events to customer-facing experiences across email, SMS, push, chat, and in-app. It is designed around clear separation of environments, reusable notification logic, and a delivery pipeline you can monitor and evolve without rewrites.

At a high level you send a single event to Dokaai, the platform resolves who should receive the message, renders content from templates, chooses the right channels, and delivers through configured providers. For in-app experiences, you drop in the <Method href="/platform/inbox/react/components/inbox">{`<Inbox />`}</Method> component and Dokaai streams updates in real time.

## Platform overview

The platform is composed of a few core building blocks that work together:

- **Workspaces and environments**: isolate configuration and data by stage (dev, staging, production).
- **Notifications**: define the message steps, channel logic, and rules for delivery.
- **Subscribers**: represent your end users and their preferences.
- **Integrations**: connect Dokaai to email, SMS, push, and chat providers.
- **Inbox**: deliver in-app messages directly in your UI.
- **Observability**: track delivery, errors, and engagement in one place.

## Workspaces and environments

Each workspace can contain multiple environments so you can develop safely and release confidently. Environments control:

- API keys and access tokens
- provider credentials
- templates and workflows
- data isolation for subscribers, events, and message history

Typical structure:

- **Development**: rapid iteration with test users
- **Staging**: near-production validation
- **Production**: live traffic and reporting

This separation keeps testing data out of production and makes rollbacks or migrations less risky.

## Notifications and workflow steps

A notification is a structured sequence of steps that describes what should be delivered and when. Each step can be:

- a channel step (email, SMS, push, chat, in-app)
- a control step (delay, conditional routing, digest, throttling)

Notifications are versioned so you can iterate without breaking existing integrations. A single event can drive multiple steps, and each step can use its own template and provider configuration.

If you are new to notifications, start with a simple template and add channel steps as you go. You can later add routing rules to only send certain channels based on user preferences or message context.

## Subscribers and topics

Subscribers represent your end users. Each subscriber typically includes:

- a stable `subscriberId`
- channel identifiers (email, phone number, device token)
- profile metadata (name, locale, plan)
- delivery preferences (opt-in/out, channel priority)

To target groups you can use topics. Topics let you address many subscribers without loading or listing each one in your app. You can also set rules to resolve dynamic groups at send time.

## Inbox and in-app delivery

The <Method href="/platform/inbox/react/components/inbox">{`<Inbox />`}</Method> component is Dokaai's in-app delivery endpoint. It connects to your environment, listens for new messages, and renders notifications inside your product.

The inbox supports:

- real-time updates
- read/unread state
- actions and deep links
- preference controls for the user

When an in-app step runs, Dokaai stores the notification and makes it available to the Inbox component immediately.

## Integrations and providers

Integrations connect Dokaai to the services that actually deliver messages. Configure them per environment so production and staging credentials stay separate.

Common provider types:

- email (SendGrid, SES, Mailgun)
- SMS (Twilio, MessageBird)
- push (FCM, APNs)
- chat (Slack, Teams)

Each notification step chooses an integration based on channel and rules. If a provider is missing, Dokaai will surface a clear error in delivery logs.

## Event intake and delivery pipeline

When you call the API, Dokaai processes the event through a predictable pipeline:

1. **Validate** the request and resolve the environment.
2. **Resolve subscribers** and expand any topics.
3. **Render templates** with your payload data.
4. **Apply routing rules** and timing controls.
5. **Deliver** via the chosen providers.
6. **Record** delivery outcomes for analytics.

The pipeline is designed to be consistent across channels so you can reason about delivery behavior in a single mental model.

## Templates and localization

Templates power the message content for each channel. You can:

- reuse shared partials across multiple notifications
- insert dynamic variables from the event payload
- localize content by language or locale
- version templates alongside your workflow updates

Template compilation happens at send time so your content always reflects current data.

## Preferences and compliance

Dokaai respects user preferences at the subscriber level and enforces channel opt-in or opt-out rules. You can define:

- channel priority or fallbacks
- quiet hours or time windows
- global unsubscribe rules
- per-notification overrides

This helps you stay compliant while still delivering critical messages.

## Observability and analytics

Every message step records a delivery outcome. You can track:

- provider errors and retries
- delivery latency
- open and click events
- inbox interactions

This makes it easy to diagnose issues and measure impact without instrumenting each channel separately.

## Security and access control

Dokaai uses scoped API keys per environment and supports role-based access so teams can manage permissions safely.

Best practices:

- keep production keys in a secrets manager
- restrict staging access to internal teams
- rotate keys on a schedule
- separate admin roles from read-only roles

## Getting started

If you want to try the platform end to end:

1. Create a development environment.
2. Add one integration (email or SMS).
3. Create a simple notification with a single channel step.
4. Send a test event with a sample subscriber.
5. Add the <Method href="/platform/inbox/react/components/inbox">{`<Inbox />`}</Method> component for in-app delivery.

From there you can scale out to additional channels, workflows, and advanced routing.
