# How Dokaai Works

Dokaai is a notification platform that connects your product events to customer-facing experiences across email, SMS, push, chat, and in-app. It is designed around clear separation of environments, reusable notification logic, and a delivery pipeline you can monitor and evolve without rewrites.

At a high level you send a single event to Dokaai, the platform resolves who should receive the message, renders content from templates, chooses the right channels, and delivers through configured providers. For in-app experiences, you drop in the <Method>{`<Inbox />`}</Method> component and Dokaai streams updates in real time.

## Platform overview

The platform is composed of a few core building blocks that work together:

- **Workspaces and environments**: isolate configuration and data by stage (dev, staging, production).
- **Notifications**: define the message steps, channel logic, and rules for delivery.
- **Subscribers**: represent your end users and their preferences.
- **Integrations**: connect Dokaai to email, SMS, push, and chat providers.
- **Inbox**: deliver in-app messages directly in your UI.
- **Observability**: track delivery, errors, and engagement in one place.
